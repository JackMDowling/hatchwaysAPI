Back End Assessment
Alright, here is my submission. Overall I think it went well. Implemented very simple caching, I would have liked to have extended this part but I felt
like I was already going long on time. In regards to time, I do apologize. I am currently working as a teacher and had a lot of classes last week. I tried to make
this solution as elegant as possible. Anyway, to run:

npm install
npm start
npm run test

Easy as that! I hope you enjoy my work, I certainly enjoyed writing it.
